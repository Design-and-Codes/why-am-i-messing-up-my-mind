                <p>It's weird to see myself making the same mistakes over and over again.</p>
                <p>Like brother, are you being okay?</p>
                <p>But fortunately, since the last few days, I find myself in a calm state, not being pitty against my own me.</p>
                <p>There's no need for me to hate myself. Since I am going to face me again later on in life, and I am the only one who is there for me.</p>
